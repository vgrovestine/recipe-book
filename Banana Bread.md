# Banana Bread

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 Cups flour
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 3 medium bananas (extra-ripe/spotted-brown; approx 1 Cup mashed)
* 1 egg
* 1/4 Cup molasses
* 1/2 Cup sugar
* 1/4 Cup vegetable oil (or melted butter/margerine)

## Instructions

Mash bananas thoroughly and combine with egg, molasses, sugar and oil. 

Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon in another bowl.

Add wet mixture to dry ingredients. Stir until moistened. The batter will be somewhat lumpy.

Grease bottom and sides of a loaf pan. Alternatively, use large muffin liners. Pour batter into the pan/liners.

Bake at 350Â°F for 50-55 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. If you opted for muffins instead of a loaf, test for doneness after 40 minutes.

## Servings

Makes approximately 10-12 slices.
