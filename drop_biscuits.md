# Drop Biscuits

## Ingredients

* 2 Cups flour
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/3 Cup shortening
* 1 Cup milk

## Instructions

Combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender (or a fork) until the mixture resembles coarse, rough crumbs. Add milk and mix by hand until just combined with the dry ingredients. The dough will be a somewhat sticky mass.

Drop dough by large spoonful on an ungreased cookie sheet—blobs should be slightly bigger than a golf ball.

Bake at 425°F for 13 minutes.

## Servings

Makes approximately 12 biscuits.
