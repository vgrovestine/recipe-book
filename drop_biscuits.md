# Drop Biscuits

## Ingredients

2 Cups flour
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 Cup shortening
1 Cup milk

## Instructions

Combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender (or a fork) until the mixture resembles coarse, rough crumbs. Add milk and mix by hand until just combined with the dry ingredients. The dough will be a somewhat sticky mass.

Drop dough by the spoonful on an ungreased cookie sheet--blobs should be slightly larger than a golf ball.

Bake @ 425F for 13 minutes.

Makes 12 biscuits.
