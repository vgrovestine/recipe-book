# Peanut Butter Overnight Oats

## Ingredients

* 1 Cup rolled oats (quick oats not recommended)
* 1 Cup milk or non-dairy alternative (almond, cashew, oat, etc.)
* 2 Tbsp peanut butter
* 2 tsp maple syrup
* _(optional)_ 2 tsp chia seeds

## Instructions

In a large glass container, combine all ingredients until well mixed. Oats should be submerged--Add a bit more milk if the mixture appears too dry.

Cover the container tightly and place it in the fridge for at least 8 hours (e.g. overnight).

## Servings

Makes 2-3 servings. Prepared oats will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days, but may become stodgy toward the end.
