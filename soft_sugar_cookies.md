# Soft Sugar Cookies

## Ingredients

* 1/2 Cup margarine or butter, softened
* 1 Cup sugar
* 1 egg
* 2 1/2 Cups flour
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 Cup milk
* 1/2 tsp vanilla

## Instructions

Cream together butter and sugar. Add egg and vanilla. Beat until well-mixed.

Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder in a seperate bowl.

Alternately add dry ingredients and milk into the earlier mixture. Dough should be relatively stiff as it comes together.

If the dough feels especially soft, you may wish to let it rest in the fridge for a couple hours before baking. 

Shape dough into ping-pong-sized balls.

Bake at 375Â°F for 10-12 minutes on a non-stick or parchment-lined cookie sheet.

## Servings

Makes approximately 30 cookies.

## Note

The dough freezes well. To cook from frozen, add 1 minute to its baking time.
